### Software developer that loves to code silly things and do web development for work. 

I love coding in C# but was taught Java in high school and that's mainly how I got into programming. I know C#, Java/Kotlin, JavaScript/TypeScript and for web development I use React and Next.js mostly.
#### What I do at work
- Backend work in Kotlin using Spring Boot
- Frontend work in Next.js/React
- Building applications used for administration but also apps used by users

#### When I'm bored I work on my own personal projects
- Discord bot called Azimuth, mainly made for me and my friends
  - Currently private, because I'm lazy to remove all the tokens etc. from git history
- A tool named Beholder for Pterodactyl that collects and parses chat logs from game servers and sends them to discord
  - It also lets me send an global server-wide announcement that gets sent to every hosted server on my Pterodactyl node
- [My personal website of course](https://github.com/antoninvf/flwn.dev) which you can visit [right here](https://flwn.dev)
- Voxel game that I don't know if I'll ever finish but it's cool :)
 
 #### My other hobbies
- Building up my home server called ZEPHYR
  - Currently runs my game servers, Plex, my website and APIs and much more
- Listening to music using Plexamp and tracking it via [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/flowyan)
  - You can see the song I'm currently listening to on my [site](https://flwn.dev)
- I like making Minecraft mods and plugins for my own servers

that's about it :)
